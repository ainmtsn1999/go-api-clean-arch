# go-api-clean-arch
its repository to learn how to make a clean arch in golang. basically its just a documentation for me. i take some article like :
- https://medium.com/golangid/mencoba-golang-clean-architecture-c2462f355f41
- https://evrone.com/go-clean-template

so it will be ready sooner here.
