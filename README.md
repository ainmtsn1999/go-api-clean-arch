# go-api-clean-arch
its repository for me to learn how to make a clean arch in golang. so basically its just a documentation from me and for me. i take some article to learn like :
- https://medium.com/golangid/mencoba-golang-clean-architecture-c2462f355f41
- https://evrone.com/go-clean-template

so it will be ready sooner here.
